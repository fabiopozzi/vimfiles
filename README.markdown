Vimfiles
=======

These are my personal vimfiles including:including

* the vimrc file
* the bundle folder containing plugins handled by [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle "vundle")

The plugin I use in this configuration are
* ack.vim
* autoload\_cscope
* cscope\-quickfix
* cscope.vim
* nerdcommenter
* nerdtree
* tagbar
* matchit
* vim-fugitive
* vundle
* ZoomWin
* ctrlp
* gundo
 
All of them are fetched from github repos by bundle, so the plugin links
can be found inside the vimrc file.

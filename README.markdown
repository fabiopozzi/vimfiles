Vimfiles
=======

These are my personal vimfiles, including:

* the vimrc file
* the bundle folder containing plugins 
  handled by [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle "vundle")

The plugin I use in this configuration are
* ack.vim
* autoload\_cscope
* cscope\-quickfix
* cscope.vim
* nerdcommenter
* nerdtree
* tagbar
* vim-fugitive
* vundle
* ZoomWin
* ctrlp
* gundo
* vim-airline

All of them are fetched from github repos by vundle thus all links to the
plugins I use can be found inside the vimrc file.
